## Let ${\hat{\theta}}$ be an estimator.

Bias
: The difference between the expected value of the estimates to the actual value of what's being estimated.

Mean square error
: the average of the square of the distance between the estimator and its target parameter. Used to determine how well the estimator estimates the parameter.
